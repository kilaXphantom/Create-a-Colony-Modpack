## How to Play
This pack uses Packwiz for managing mods and other files. The official guide on how to prepare a MultiMC/Prism Launcher instance can be found [here](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/). The pack is hosted at ``https://kilaxphantom.github.io/Create-a-Colony-Modpack/pack.toml``.

The easiest way to play this is to download the Instance provided in [the latest release](https://github.com/kilaXphantom/the-transcontinental-co/releases/tag/modpack) and import it into Prism Launcher.
